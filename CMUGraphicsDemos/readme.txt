REMEMBER that you will almost certainly need to put your cmu_graphics folder
in the same folder as the python file you wish to run.  Alternatively, move these 
files out of this location and into your term project folder.  

If you use or modify more than a few lines of code from these demos, 
please remember to cite them in a comment!

The documentation for PIL/Pillow is here:

The answers to most of your image manipulation questions can be found there!

The kirbleBirdStarter.py file shows off animated gifs, transparency, OOP, and 
a few other things from lecture (4/11/23) but has plenty of things missing,
including collisions.  Also note that it WILL slow down over time because of
the orb list getting ever-longer.  Can you figure out how to remove orbs from
the list once they're off the left edge of the canvas?

Huge thanks to Melinda Chen for making these:
